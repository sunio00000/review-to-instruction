description: Use when implementing this pattern. Focus on i18n.

The reviewer is requesting that the implementation be modified to handle Korean language text (Hangul) in addition to English. This typically applies to regular expressions, validation logic, character encoding, or input processing where the current implementation only accounts for English alphabetic characters. The code should be internationalized to properly support both character sets to avoid excluding Korean users or data.
