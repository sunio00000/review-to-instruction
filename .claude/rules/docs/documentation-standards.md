# Documentation Documentation

All source code comments, documentation, and annotations must be written exclusively in English to ensure international team accessibility and align with industry standards.

## Rules

- This coding convention establishes a mandatory language policy for all textual content within the codebase. The rule requires that every form of code documentation—including inline comments, JSDoc/TSDoc annotations, README files, and any other source code annotations—be written in English rather than Korean or any other language. This standardization serves multiple strategic purposes: it ensures the codebase remains accessible to developers globally regardless of their native language, facilitates seamless collaboration in distributed and international teams, improves long-term code maintainability by allowing any developer to understand the code context, and aligns with widely-accepted industry practices where English serves as the lingua franca for technical communication. The P1 priority designation indicates this is a critical requirement that must be addressed before code can be merged into the main branch.
