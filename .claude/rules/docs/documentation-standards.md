# Documentation Documentation

All source code comments must be written in English, not in Korean or other languages.

## Rules

- This is a code documentation standard requiring that all comments within source files be written in English rather than the native language (Korean in this case). This practice ensures code maintainability and accessibility for international team members, enables better collaboration in global development environments, and facilitates code sharing across diverse teams. English comments make the codebase more portable and understandable to a broader audience of developers who may work with the code in the future.
