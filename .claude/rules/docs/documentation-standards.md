# Documentation Documentation

All source code comments must be written in English instead of Korean to ensure consistency and accessibility for international developers.

## Rules

- This review enforces a language standardization policy for code comments. The team requires that all inline comments, documentation comments, and source code annotations be written exclusively in English rather than Korean (or any other language). This practice ensures that the codebase is accessible to all developers regardless of their native language, facilitates collaboration in international teams, improves code maintainability when developers from different regions work on the same project, and aligns with industry-standard practices where English is the de facto language for technical documentation. The 'P1' priority indicates this is a high-priority issue that should be addressed before merging.
